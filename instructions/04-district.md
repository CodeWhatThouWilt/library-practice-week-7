# Create a district class

## Introduction:

In this exercise, we're going to create a District class. This class will handle multiple libraries in a district and provide useful information about them.

## Steps:

1. Declare a class named District. This class will not have a constructor.

2. Define a static property named libraries and initialize it as an empty array.

3. Implement a static method named addLibrary(library). This method should add the passed library object to the libraries array.

4. Create two static methods getAllPatrons() and countAllPatrons().

   - getAllPatrons() should return an array containing all patron objects from all libraries in the district.

   - countAllPatrons() should return a count of all patrons in all libraries in the district.

5. Create two more static methods getAllBooks() and countAllBooks().

   - getAllBooks() should return an array containing all book objects from all libraries in the district.

   - countAllBooks() should return a count of all books in all libraries in the district.
