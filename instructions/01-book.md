# Create a book class

## Introduction:

In this exercise, we will be constructing a Book class. Each instance of this class will represent a unique book in a library.

## Steps:

1. Declare a class called Book.

2. Add a constructor that accepts three parameters: id, title, and author. Assign these to instance variables with the same names.

3. Also in the constructor, create a checkedOut variable and set its initial value to false.

4. Define a checkOut() method. This method should change the checkedOut instance variable to true.

5. Define a return() method. This method should change the checkedOut instance variable back to false.
