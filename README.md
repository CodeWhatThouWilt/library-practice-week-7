# Library Class Project

First things first, make sure to do an npm install!

```
npm install
```

We're going to create a system for a district to track
all of their libraries, books and patrons.

By the end we should be able to do the following:

- Get a list of all patrons for the whole district
- Get a count of all patrons for the whole district

- Add new patrons to a library
- Get a list of all patrons for a specific library
- Get a count of all patrons for a specific library

- Get a list of all books in the district
- Get a count of all books in the district

- Get a list of all books in a specific library
- Get a count of all books in a specific library
- See if a specific book is checked out

- Transfer a book from one library to another

- See the max amount of books a library can hold
- See how close to the max inventory a library is

- Check books out to a specific patron
- Have books returned from a specific patron
- See what books a specific patron has checked out
- Do a search of titles to see if a library has a book

The practice should be done in this order:

1. Book
2. Patron
3. Library
4. District
